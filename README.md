## Install

```fish
$ omf install underbar
```


## Usage
This plugin warps a command so the stdout will be assigned to a dedicated variable.  
It is supposed to work with a custom key binding.  
The default key binding is not provided, so after the installation, bind a preferred key sequence with this plugin before use.  
For example:
```fish
# bind alt+g
$ bind \eg underbar
# type a command in command line, then press alt+g to let the function expand your command, and finally press enter to execute it.
$ echo 'foo
bar'
# then the content of stdout is kept in the global variable underbar, and you can manipulate it like any other Fish variables,
# or inspect.
$ set --show underbar
```
> $underbar: set in global scope, unexported, with 2 elements  
> $underbar[1]: |foo|  
> $underbar[2]: |bar|  

By pressing the binding key again, the wrap is toggle-off.  

By binding another function named `underbar_show`, it will be easy to inspect the variable.  
For example:
```fish
# bind alt+i
$ bind \ei underbar_show
# then press alt+i, `set --show underbar` is executed, and prior content is shown.
```
